RASPBIAN BUILD NOTES
================
Prerequisites
--------

Raspberry Pi (tested Pi 3 1GB RAM)
Another PC with SD card slot
Internet access
SD card for OS (min 8 GB, 32GB recommended)
HDD for blockchain (optional)

Raspbian OS
--------

Get these Raspbian OS Jessie IMG -> https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2017-07-05/
Flash it into Your SD card.
* You could also use distribution swap on live Raspbian, but I've never tried it myself, some tutorials could be found on the internet.

Raspbian - Configuration
--------

First boot could take a while. When You are loged on access terminal.
1. Raspi-config
type: 
  sudo raspi-config
->Make filesystem use whole SD card
->Change Memory Split to 16MB
->Set Your locale
->Enable login into CLI client
->Finish & Reboot
2. Cleaning an Image
type following commands one by one:
  sudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice*
  sudo apt-get clean
  sudo apt-get autoremove
3.Updating repositories
type:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo reboot

Dependencies Building
--------

Type following in teminal:
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install git build-essential libdb++-dev libboost-all-dev make libssl-dev libminiupnpc-dev && reboot
Wait for it to fininsh and reboot
Then make pull directory (or just navigate to main directory):
  mkdir ~/B3coin && cd ~/B3coin
  or 
  cd ~/
Then type following:
  git clone https://github.com/B3-Coin/B3-CoinV2.git
When it finish type one by one:
  cd ~/[B3Coin diretory]/src/leveldb/
  chmod +x build_detect_platform
  make clean
  make libmemenv.a libleveldb.a
Once it's done, You're ready to go. If You are using previous versions of RPi you may consider creating SWAP file now, with RPi 3 there
is no need to do so. Various tutorials could be found over internet.

To Build
--------

  cd src/
  make -f makefile.unix            # Headless b3coin
  strip b3coind                    # Optional but greatly reduce binary size
Be patient now, proccess could take up to few hours, once it's done b3coind executable will be created in main B3coin directory.
For easy of future use of Your newly compiled b3coind type following:
  sudo mv b3coind /usr/local/bin
This little trick allows You to access b3coind from any directory on Your RPi.

Right now You can just type:
  b3coind -daemon
And enjoy Your CLI Raspberry Pi B3coin wallet! :D
For future use You can compile QT wallet or use console command paired with 'b3coind' to access Your wallet, examples:
  b3coind getstakinginfo
  b3coind getinfo
  b3coind listunspent
  etc...

Donations greatly appreciated :)

 libdb       Berkeley DB       Blockchain & wallet storage
 libboost    Boost             C++ Library
 miniupnpc   UPnP Support      Optional firewall-jumping support

miniupnpc may be used for UPnP port mapping.  It can be downloaded from
http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/.  UPnP support is compiled in and
turned off by default.  Set USE_UPNP to a different value to control this:
 USE_UPNP=-    No UPnP support - miniupnp not required
 USE_UPNP=0    (the default) UPnP support turned off by default at runtime
 USE_UPNP=1    UPnP support turned on by default at runtime

Licenses of statically linked libraries:
 Berkeley DB   New BSD license with additional requirement that linked
               software must be free open source
 Boost         MIT-like license
 miniupnpc     New (3-clause) BSD license
